# Constraint optimization for a party staff scheduling problem
Small (old) demo of constraint optimization for a party staff scheduling problem - with Choco-solver 3.3

ðŸ˜® hold on ... what is that exactly, a *party*? You might have forgotten this concept after one year of Covid-19, so here is the definition on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party)

## Installation / code
This is a maven project (installed with IntelliJ). All code of the demo is in `src/main/java/PartyProblem.java`

Enjoy the party (problem)!
